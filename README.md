:raising_hand:She/Her

:computer:I currently learning HTML, CSS, & Javascript skills, and looking forward to strengthening these skills.
:pencil2:I would love to learn digital illustration.
:yellow_heart: I would love to connect, and hear about your inspiring tech journeys!

A little extra about me:
:no_entry_sign:If you ask me if I've seen the most recent show, or movie, I will most likely answer, "No."
:heart_eyes:But ask me about art, hiking, personal-development, and all things spiritual, and I'm all ears!!
